# üìö Educational Jupyter Notebooks: Numerical Optimization and Scientific Computing
![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/larrywigington/Educational-Notebooks)

A collection of step-by-step Jupyter Notebooks designed to teach **numerical linear algebra**, **optimization algorithms**, and **scientific computing methods** ‚Äî combining theory, intuition, and clean Python implementations.

## üß† Project Overview

Understanding numerical algorithms deeply requires more than just code ‚Äî it demands intuition about convergence, stability, and structure.

These notebooks aim to:
- Walk through **theory first** (intuitive derivations)
- Provide **clear, minimal Python implementations**
- Highlight **common pitfalls** and **best practices**
- Enable hands-on experimentation with **scientific problems**

Built using:
- **Python 3.9+**
- **NumPy**, **SciPy**, **Matplotlib**
- (Optional) **CuPy** for GPU acceleration (in select examples)
